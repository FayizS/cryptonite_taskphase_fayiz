## Who are you?
### HTTP requests
1. Initiating the Request
When you enter a URL (e.g., https://example.com) in your browser, your browser sends an HTTPS request to the server that hosts the website.
2. Establishing a Secure Connection
HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the communication. Here's how it ensures security:

a. Handshake:
The browser contacts the server and requests a secure connection.
The server sends a digital certificate (proof of its identity).
The browser verifies the certificate using a Certificate Authority (CA). If the certificate is valid, the browser trusts the server.

b. Key Exchange:
The browser and server generate session keys (unique for this session) to encrypt the data exchanged.

3. Sending the Request
Once the secure connection is established:
The browser sends the actual HTTP request to the server, such as:
```
Copy code
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
This request is encrypted, so anyone intercepting it cannot read the contents.

4. Server Processes the Request
The server decrypts the request, processes it, and sends a response (e.g., the website content) back to the browser.
The response is also encrypted before being sent.

6. Receiving the Response
The browser decrypts the serverâ€™s response using the session keys.
It displays the content (e.g., a webpage) to you.

GET method - used to request data from a specified resource. 
POST method - used to send data to a server to update a resource.

Suppose we have this request:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: mercury.picoctf.net:38322
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.6778.86 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```
- RFCs(Request For Comments) governs the structure and behavior of the request.
- `GET / HTTP/1.1` -> follows _HTTP Request/response Protocol_ (if it was a response the former won't be there)
- `Host:`, `User-Agent:` and all are headers, which are key-value pairs which provide data about requests and responses.
- There are different RFCs specifying the format for each header.
